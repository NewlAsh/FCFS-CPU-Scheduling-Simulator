## 📌 Overview

This project is a simulation of the **First Come First Serve (FCFS) CPU Scheduling Algorithm** implemented in **C++** using **Object-Oriented Programming principles**.

The program reads process details from a file, schedules them based on FCFS logic, and calculates key scheduling metrics such as:

- Completion Time
- Turnaround Time
- Waiting Time
- Average Waiting Time
- Average Turnaround Time

The final schedule and results are written to an output file in a tabular format.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- C++
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File Handling
- STL (vector, stringstream)

## 🎯 Key Learnings

- Practical understanding of CPU Scheduling algorithms
- Applying Object-Oriented Design for clean code structure
- Encapsulation using classes and getters
- File input/output handling in C++
- Computing performance metrics for scheduling algorithms
